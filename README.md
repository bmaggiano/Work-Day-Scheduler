# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This app serves to help it's user by allowing the user to take control of their day. Timeblocking is a very important part of having a successful day as well as a successful home/work balance, and this app allows a user to enter text for every hour of their day. Using if/else if/else statements, the background colors are changed to show the user red if that hour is current, grey if the hour has passed, and green if the hour hasn't come yet. Using local storage, the user is free to exit the browser and come back knowing their changes are saved and stored.

This app is also the first instance of Bootstrap in my UofA portfolio and allowed me to create a nice UI without having to hard code a lot of the HTML elements from scratch. The work day scheduler is something that should be utilized and the accountability is something that will be very useful to its user.
